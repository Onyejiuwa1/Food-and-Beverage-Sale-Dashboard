# Food-and-Beverage-Sale-Dashboard
This project focuses on analyzing sales data in order to provide useful insights for a contrived sales and distribution (X Food and Beverage) company, using Excel to clean and transform data and to create visualizations using Tableau.
Case Study: X Foods and Beverages, a leading provider of food products and beverages, is dedicated to enhancing customer experience and streamlining operations. To achieve this goal, the company has partnered with me, an external consultant, to conduct a comprehensive analysis of their sales data. This project aims to deliver actionable insights and data-driven visuals, ultimately driving business growth and informed decision-making.

Business Questions:
- What is the total revenue generated?
- What is the total number of orders placed?
- What is the Average Ticket Price (ATP)?
- Who are the top 3 salespersons by orders and by revenue?
- Total orders by product category
- Monthly distribution of revenue and orders
- Distribution of revenue by channel

Key Insights
> A total revenue of $18m has been so far generated from a total of 52.6 thousand orders and customers were wiling to spend an average of $340.7 on a product.
> Julio Lima, Carla Ferreira, and Gustavo Gomes are the peak performers by orders and revenue.
> A vast majority of the orders placed were on the food category having a total of 47.4 thousand orders as against orders on drinks which summed up to 5.1 thousand orders.
> It was observed that more sales were made towards the end of the year with October recording the peak revenue and highest orders repeatedly over the business's years of existence.
> Products sold on retail recorded the highest revenue followed by the products distributed, while online sales yielded the least revenue.

Conclusion
Although X Food and Beverages is just in her 3rd year of existence, there is a significant increase in revenue after each successive year. With more data on customer demographics, reviews and suggestions X Food and Beverages will be more equipped to make even better decisions.
